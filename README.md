# Logistic-Regression-Implementation

For this second problem, we will perform binary classifications of facial expressions using a logistic regression classifier. The main goal is to successfully write the predict and train functions for the classifier. The dataset we are using is quite noisy and was obtained from the 2013 Kaggle facial expression classification competition1. Although the original dataset contained 7 emotional classes, 3), we will only use two of them (happy or positive valence and sad or negative valence).
